# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement iteration 1 scaffolding: a .NET 9 minimal API with `GET /health` and a Vite React TypeScript frontend that fetches and displays that health status. Include CORS for local dev and a mobile-first baseline (viewport meta, responsive layout, design tokens) so we can rapidly build core gameplay next.
